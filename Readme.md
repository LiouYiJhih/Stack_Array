#### A stack is an object (an abstract data type - ADT) that allows the following operations:

1. Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
2. Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
3. IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
4. IsFull: Check if the stack is full
5. Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it
